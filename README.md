# Data-Science-Projects
This is the repo in which I post my data science, machine learning, deep learning and statistics projects.

My projects so far:

- [*Analyse et p√©diction des prochaines musiques hits de Billboard*](https://github.com/JBobyM/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/classeur%20de%20musique_partie_1) is a two-part project in which I tried to predict popularity level of music based on variables related to the audio and the artists. This project is published and well-documented on my Medium data science blog. You can get access to it [here](https://medium.com/@jbobym).
