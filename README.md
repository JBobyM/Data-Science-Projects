# Data-Science-Projects
This is the repo in which I post my data science, machine learning, deep learning and statistics projects.

My projects so far:

- [*PÃ©diction des prochaines musiques hits*](https://github.com/JBobyM/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/classeur%20de%20musique_partie_1) is a two-part project in which I tried to predict popularity level of music based on variables related to the audio and the artists. This project is published and well-documented on my blog. You can get access to it [here](https://jbobym.github.io/Pr%C3%A9diction_des_prochaines_musiques_hits_(partie_1)).
